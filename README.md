Hello and welcome! This is my frist real project on my own and will be trying to get this app up and running locally to internalize everything I have learned.

### Step-by-Step Plan

#### Phase 1: Planning and Design

1. **Define the Core Features**:
    
    - User authentication (optional if it's just for you).
    - Story creation and editing.
    - Story navigation with choices.
    - Save and load progress.
2. **Design the App**:
    
    - Simple UI sketches for story creation, navigation, and progress management.
    - Plan the database schema and API endpoints.

Phase 2: Set Up the Development Environment

Phase 3: Backend Development

Phase 4: Frontend Development

Phase 5: Implement Core Features

Phase 6: Testing

Phase 7: Deployment
